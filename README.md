# weather-me

Weatherme uses your current location and provides weather forecast upto 10 days. The application uses googles geocode api (http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/) to retrieve your city information, googles static map api (http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap) to get static map of your current location and wundergrounds weather api (http://api.wunderground.com/api/) to get weather forecast data. To get started, download the project, run 'npm install' to install node dependencies, run 'bower install' to install library dependencies and run 'grunt serve' for a live preview. 

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
